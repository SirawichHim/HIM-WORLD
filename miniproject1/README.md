# The sqlite-sakila dataset was utilized for this project.
- This project is divided into 2 parts
  - SQL for cleaning and preparing data
    - P.S. I used the limit function because there's a large amount of data that the website cannot process.
      - https://replit.com/@SirawichRattana/Project01
  - Power BI for data visualization
 

- Data source : https://github.com/ivanceras/sakila/tree/master/sqlite-sakila-db

  GOOD LUCK ON THIS DAY :)
